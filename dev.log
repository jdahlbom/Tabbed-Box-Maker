2019/01/02 Tests fixed - what was I doing again?

I finally figured out what was wrong with my tests - not my code, but rather the expectations made
in the tests.

Now I have done that, I have no idea what was the main goal I was going for in this change.

Big picture: 
Tray creation should operate on much higher abstraction level, "16 cards with Mayday Mini Euro sleeve"-level.

To get there: 
Tray creation needs to use absolute positioning within a piece, in order to make it easier to
generate each piece from high level specification.

Earlier thoughts, as I recall it:
Trays should be specified row-wise as a series of slots with minimum size requirements and possible elasticity,
intermediate tray configuration should be computed and generated from that specification into absolute coordinates.
