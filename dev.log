Turns out Inkscape viewer does not in fact us the specified viewBox but rather changes to viewbox
to pixel scale. mm to pixel scale is 0.26458

In inkscape 0.92 this can be corrected by setting File > Document Properties > Viewbox : Set the width
and height to the specified Custom Size. Paths should have the right scale then.
