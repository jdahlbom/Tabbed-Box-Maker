A2 Monster and event cards on 3.5mm in Epilog Fusion M2  21 min
"Reduced" event cards and monster card, 2mm, in Epilog Fusion M2  1.5 min


2018/08/21  Did first cuts with 3.5mm, the accumulating nature of hole
cutting broke when switched from 3 -> 3.5mm. Need to implement absolute
positioning of holes.


Notes on card measurements:
Assume card stock of "80 pound paper", and use .01 inches as thickness.
https://bizfluent.com/facts-7618919-card-stock-thickness-guide.html

.01 inch is approximately 0.26mm, so assume 0.3mm per card for safety

Mayday bulk sleeves are 40 microns thick, so 0.04mm.

Total per card thickness is then 0.35 mm
